# FDelivery api
A flask restful API for our Business and Couriers application.

The API allows communication between businesses looking for delivery services to couriers looking to do accept those deliveries.  
Using real-time communication over SocketIO to allow synchronization between all clients running over the Android application, the API has multiple REST Service Endpoints to manganese resources states.  
The API uses JWT for authorization and authentication, allowing scalability over sessions because the token is on the client side.

## Installation / Usage
* If you wish to run your own build, first ensure you have python3 globally installed in your computer. If not, you can get python3 [here](https://www.python.org).
* After this, ensure you have installed virtualenv globally as well. If not, run this:
    ```
        $ pip install pipenv
    ```
* Git clone this repo to your PC
    ```
        $ git clone git@github.com:gitgik/flask-rest-api.git
    ```


* #### Dependencies
    1. Cd into your the cloned repo as such:
        ```
        $ cd flask-rest-api
        ```

    2. Create and fire up your virtual environment in python3:
        ```
        $ pipenv install autoenv
        ```

* #### Environment Variables
    Create a .env file and add the following:

    ```
        $ JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'VERY-SECRET'
        $ MONGODB_HOST = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/app'
    ```

    Save the file. CD out of the directory and back in. `Autoenv` will automagically set the variables.

* #### Install your requirements
    ```
    $ pipenv install
    ```


* #### Running It
    On your terminal, run the server using this one simple command:
    ```
    (venv)$ flask run
    ```
    You can now access the app on your local browser by using
    ```
    http://localhost:5000/
    ```
    Or test creating deliveries using Postman
